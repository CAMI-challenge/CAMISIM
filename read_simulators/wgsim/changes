This version is an adapted version of wgsim 0.3.0, introducing some changes compared to the original wgsim 0.3.0
1. wgsim produces an sam-file in addition to the read files, indicating the mapping of the reads to the reference genome
2. Instead of using recurrent sequencing errors, random sequencing errors are re-introduced (commented out in original wgsim code)
