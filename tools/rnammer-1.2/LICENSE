agreements whether written or oral, and all other communications among
the parties relating to the subject matter of this Agreement. This
Agreement cannot be modified except in writing and signed by both
parties. Failure by either party at any time to enforce any of the
provisions of this Agreement shall not constitute a waiver by such party

The invalidity of singular provisions does not affect the validity of
the entire understanding. The parties are obligated, however, to replace
the invalid provisions by a regulation which comes closest to the
economic intent of the invalid provision. The same shall apply mutatis
mutandis in case of a gap.

duly executed on the date of the download of the software and by
