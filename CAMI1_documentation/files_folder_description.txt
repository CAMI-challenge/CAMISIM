output_folder/
	distributions/
		a folder where distributions for all samples will be stored
		distribution_{i}.txt
			files for all different distributions, generated by make_community:
			format: genome_ID	abundance
	internal/
		folder containing metadata of all genomes
		genome_locations.tsv
			file contains a file path for each genome id after genome file cleanup
			format: genome_ID	file_path
		meta_data.tsv
			combined metadata of genomes of each community
		unused_c{i}_{}.tsv
			unused metadata of genomes of a specific community
	sample_{i}/
		a folder generated for each sample
		bam/
			folder contains bam files generated based on reads generated from the read simulator
			{genome_id}.bam
				name of the bam-files is the genome id
		fastq/
			after the read simulation has finished all all fq files are moved into this folder unless anonymous
			if anonymized, also a mapping file from anonymous reads to original sequence name
			*.fq
				If not anonymous, the original fastq files will be here
			anonymous_reads.fq
				fastq file of all anonymous reads
			reads_mapping.tsv
				mapping of reads for evaluation
				format: anonymous_read_id      genome_id       tax_id  read_id
		anonymous_gsa.fasta
			fasta file with perfect assembly of reads of this sample
		gsa_mapping.tsv
			mapping of contigs for evaluation
			format: anonymous_contig_id    genome_id       tax_id  contig_id       number_reads
	source_genomes/
		contains the cleaned up genome files, also a map file if sequences were made unique
		*.fna
